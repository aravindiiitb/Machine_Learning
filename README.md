# Machine_Learning

As I lern to implement the state-of-the-art techniques in this buzz field called Machine Learning, I would like to share it with the rest of the world. Feel free to create issues and contribute more to this repo. 

Goal is to make it one stop repository to pick any kind of model that end-user needs. This can only be acheived with your support. 


Thanks,
Aravind Kashyap
