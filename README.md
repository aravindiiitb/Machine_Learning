# Machine_Learning

As I lern to implement the state-of-the-art techniques in this buzz field called Machine Learning, I would like to share it with the rest of the world. Feel free to create issues and contribute more to this repo. 

Goal is to make it one stop repository reference to any machine learning algorithm with ready python and R codes.

## How To Contribute to This Project
Here are 3 quick and painless steps to contribute to this project:

* Add a program in any language. (A simple Hello World would suffice.)
To do so, first create an issue with the task you are doing, for example: "Issue - creating bubble sort in C". Add the `HacktoberFest` label in the issue and assign the issue to yourself. Create a pull request in response to that issue and finally submit it for review.

* Name your branch `username_hello_world_in_c`.

	Also create a directory for any new program if it doesn't exist.
	eg. `hello_world`, `bubble_sort`.
	Inside these directories you can create your own file named `program_name.language_extension` (`hello_world.cpp`)
	Create a commit of the form - fixes #(issue_number)

* Finally, wait for it to be merged!
